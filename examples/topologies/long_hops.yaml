# Long Hops Network
# A line of 64 repeaters, each with an adjacent companion.

# Network topology:
#   [Alice]--[R1]--[R2]--[R3]-- ... --[R62]--[R63]--[R64]--[Bob]
#             |     |     |            |      |      |

# Tests maximum hop counts and routing table scalability.
# Messages from Alice to Bob traverse all 64 repeaters.
